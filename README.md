# Projet Fontaine - Eau Bot

Eau Bot is a project I created using a dataset from the <a href="https://donnees.montreal.ca/ville-de-montreal/fontaines-a-boire-eau-exterieures">Montréal Données Ouvertes<a> portal, which containing location data and metadata for all of the exterior public drinking fountains in Montréal.

My motivation was to take this data and create a tool that could inform users about where to find public infrastructure - I chose water fountains because access to clean water and reducing plastic use is something I care about also. I also wanted to provide users an easy to provide direct feedback to the city about the state of its infrastructure, using a twitter bot on the backend <a href="https://twitter.com/eau_bot">@eau_bot<a>.
